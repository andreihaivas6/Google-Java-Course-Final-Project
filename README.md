# Final Project for Google Java Course 

This final project consists in implementation of two design patterns alongside with the problems they solve.

# 1. Adapter

## Description
An Adapter pattern acts as a connector between two incompatible interfaces that otherwise cannot be connected directly. An Adapter wraps an existing class with a new interface so that it becomes compatible with the clientâ€™s interface. This design pattern should be used when an outside component provides captivating functionality that we'd like to reuse, but it's incompatible with our current application.

## The problem
Given a number of American cars whose speed is measured in miles per hour, a solution must be found to adapt the speed to the European unit of measurement (kilometers per hour).

## Solution
In order to represent the cars, it was developed an abstract class **Car** that implements the interface **Movable**. Every new family of cars (ex. **Mustang**) must extends this class. In order to *Adapt* the speed it must be written an interface **MovableAdapter** which will be implemented by **MovableAdapterImplementation** that provides an implementation for converting the speed with method **convertMPHtoKMPH**.


# 2. Composite

## Description
The composite pattern is meant to allow treating individual objects and compositions of objects, or **composites** in the same way. 
It can be viewed as a tree structure made up of types that inherit a base type, and it can represent a single part or a whole hierarchy of objects.

## The problem
Given a company and its components, it must be developed a solution in order to provide a good management of company's departments.

## Solution
**Departament** is an abstract class that is a base class for every new department. It has the main role in developing the family of departments. The *Composite* element is represented by **HeadDepartment** class which contains the leaf elements (ex. **FinancialDepartment**, **HumanResourcesDepartment**) and defines the child-related operations.
